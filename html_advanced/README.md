## Semantic HTML

Semantic elements describe the purpose of content clearly.

## Accessibility (A11y)

Accessibility ensures websites work for everyone.

Key practices:

## Forms & Media

### Forms

HTML provides native validation:

- Input types like `email` and `url`

Use native features before JavaScript.
